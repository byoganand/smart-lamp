# smart-lamp

The lamp switches on or off based on if any person is near to it or not. This could save a lot of electricity as people usually forget to turn the lights off when they leave a room. Arduino uno with an ultrasonic sensor is used. Also, google api has been used to convert speech to text which will in turn command the lamp to turn on or off
